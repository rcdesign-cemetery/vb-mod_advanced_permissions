Description:
------------

This vB Addon allows to set 2 new permissions to forum moderators:

1. Move thread. Useful, if you don't wish to enable "Manage Thread" right.

2. Limit "Post Edit" permission to sticky threads. Good, when you don't want
   moderators to edit any post, but allow them edit sticky FAQ threads.
